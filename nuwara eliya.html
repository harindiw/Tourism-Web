<h2>About Nuwara Eliya</h2>
<h4><center>Nuwara Eliya is often referred to by the Sri Lankan tourist industry as ‘Little England’.<center></h4>
<p>Travelling through winding roads and lush green valleys, tea estates situated on the slopes and banks of the hills, with tiny streams and water falls and 
the beautiful misty mountains , one can arrive at Nuwara Eliya town which offers you everything, as any other town does and more.</p>

<p>Its unique climate, and often covered with an early morning mist and the cold tangy air and its fresh and invigorating atmosphere offers a typical English 
environment. Nuwara Eliya, which is situated among some of the most beautiful tea estates also has the Golf course, race Course, horses, Rose gardens and 
British style houses which all add up to a perfect vacation retreat, offering a level of perfection without equal.</p>

<h2>Places to Visit</h2>
<h3>Pedro Tea Estate</h3>
<p>To see where your morning cuppa originates, head to the Pedro Tea Estate, about 3.5km east of Nuwara Eliya on the way to Kandapola. You can take a 20-minute
 guided tour of the factory, originally built in 1885 and still packed with 19th-century engineering.  However, due to the type of tea produced here (
 a very light tea), processing only takes place at night when it’s colder, so you’re unlikely to see much action.</p>

<h3>Hakgala Gardens</h3>
<p>These attractive gardens, 10km southeast of Nuwara Eliya, are a peaceful retreat. Highlights include a fine rose garden, a 
Japanese garden, an orchid collection, cedars and giant cypresses. 
Planting season is between January and late March and at these times the gardens don't really look their best.</p>

<p>Legend has it that Hanuman, the monkey god, was sent by Rama to the Himalayas to find a particular medicinal herb. He forgot 
which herb he was looking for and decided to bring a chunk of the Himalayas back in his jaw, hoping the herb was growing on it. 
The gardens grow on a rock called Hakgala, which means ‘jaw-rock’.</p>

<h3>World's End</h3>
<p>Meaning that this is the place which has the highest gap in Sri Lanka. Situated at the border of Nuwara Eliya, Badulla and 
Ratnapura districts and Horton Plains, which is the highest plain in Sri Lanka. This place highlights the rich bio-diversity of 
Sri Lanka. This is a trail with remarkable diversity of terrain, weather, vegetation etc. It starts off with a stretch across the 
beautiful paddy fields. Climb through pines plots, grass lands, Montana forest patches, tea estates and finally through a cloud 
forest to reach Worlds End. One can view the town of Balangoda which is located way below your point of observation. Walk alone 
through the silent plain of Horton plain to the end of the world. Stand 2000 Metres high at the edge of the cold frosted grass 
land and lower your eyes towards the next land mark - the tea plantations 900 Meters below. Gaze onward beyond the waves of 
mountains, filigree of water falls, hazy lakes and paddy fields to the pink salters of Hambantota and shining sea in a horizontal 
sweep. </p>

<h3>Galway's Land National Park</h3>
<p>One of Sri Lanka's newest (2006) and smallest (29 sq hectares) national parks, Galway's Land is a dense patch of montane forest
 a couple of kilometres east of town. It is renowned for its birdlife, including 10 Sri Lankan endemics, as well as buffalo, wild 
 boar, barking deer and other mammals. There's very little on-site information, but guides are available (by donation) from the 
 park office and a 2km-long walking trail also leaves from here.</p>

<h3>Victoria Park</h3>
<p>This is one of the country's most attractive, and best-maintained, town parks. A stroll around its paths, past manicured lawns,
 is a pleasure. The park comes alive with flowers around March to May, and August and September. It’s also home to quite a number 
 of hill-country bird species, including the Kashmir flycatcher, Indian pitta and grey tit.</p>

<p>At the far end of the park is a small children’s playground and miniature train.</p>

<h3>Lake Gregory</h3>
<p>This lake is popular with domestic tourists who enjoy strolling the footpaths, taking out a swan-shaped pedal boat 
 or trotting around on a pony. However be warned that jet skis and speedboats disturb the 
peace on weekends, and during holiday times expect big crowds and funfairs. There are picnic tables, a small restaurant and a snack
 bar. Boat hire is from the smaller adjoining lake on the opposite side of the road from the main lake.</p>
